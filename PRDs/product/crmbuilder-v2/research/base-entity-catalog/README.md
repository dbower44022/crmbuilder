## Change Log

| Version | Date | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 0.6 | 05-09-26 | Tier 5 (communications detail) added: 5 Activity subclasses (activity-email, activity-phone-call, activity-meeting, activity-video-meeting, activity-sms) plus 2 standalone universal entities (document, contract). Reflects expanded scope versus original plan: Video Meeting and SMS added as distinct subclasses. All 5 communication subclasses share Activity's parent attributes and add channel-specific delta attributes only (call duration, meeting URL, message body, etc.). Catalog now stands at 42 entries: 34 universal + 8 subclasses across all 5 tiers. |
| 0.5 | 05-09-26 | Refactor: renamed `specialization` → `subclass` throughout the catalog. Same conceptual model (parent entity + discriminator + delta attributes); friendlier terminology that maps cleanly to OOP subclassing for technical readers and is intuitive to non-technical readers. Changes: `entry_kind: specialization` → `entry_kind: subclass`; directory `specializations/` → `subclasses/`; all README prose updated. No semantic change to the catalog. |

| Version | Date | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 0.4 | 05-09-26 | Tier 4 (nonprofit-specialized) added: donation, recurring-gift, grant, membership, volunteer-hour, household, affiliation, soft-credit, constituent, engagement. Plus two subclasss: account-household (Account subclass for the NPSP record-type pattern), donation-major-gift (Donation subclass for major-gift cultivation). 12 entries total. Tier 5 pending. |
| 0.3 | 05-08-26 | Tier 3 (vertical modules) added: case, solution, asset, campaign, campaign-member, email, form-submission, product, price-list, order, invoice, payment. 12 entities covering customer-service, marketing, and commerce concerns. |
| 0.2 | 05-08-26 | Tier 2 (sales pipeline) added: lead, opportunity, pipeline-stage, quote. |
| 0.1 | 05-08-26 | Initial Tier 1 sample: account, contact, activity, note, user, tag base entities plus account-nonprofit subclass. Schema established; sourcing methodology documented. |

## Purpose

This catalog is a structured reference of CRM base entity types and their attributes, surveyed across seven CRM systems. It is the foundational reference material that CRMBuilder v2 uses to guide users through entity selection, attribute selection, cross-system mapping, and gap-checking during the methodology's Inventory Reconciliation and Entity PRD phases.

The catalog answers four questions for any CRM concept (e.g., "Account," "Donation," "Activity"):

1. What is it conceptually, and why do CRMs track it?
2. What attributes typically describe it, and what do those attributes usually mean in a business context?
3. How does each surveyed CRM represent it, and what are the attributes called?
4. How does it relate to other entities?

The catalog is authored in YAML so it ingests cleanly into V2's future entity schema (Step 0 follow-on work) without requiring re-extraction from prose.

Base entity files are universal types that every (or nearly every) CRM has. Subclass files reference a parent entity, name a discriminator (the parent attribute and value that selects this subclass), and list only delta attributes that the subclass adds beyond what the parent already defines.

A subclass may end up implemented as a record type, contact subtype, type discriminator, custom property, or even a separate entity depending on the target backend's subclassing capabilities. Each subclass YAML's `systems[]` block names the implementation pattern per system using a controlled `mechanism` vocabulary so V2 knows how to deploy the subclass to whichever target CRM is selected.

## Entity YAML schema

Every base-entity YAML file follows this shape. Subclass files use the same shape with two additions: `entry_kind: subclass`, `parent_entity` reference, and a `discriminator` block.

### Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `catalog_id` | string | yes | Stable identifier; matches filename minus `.yaml`. lowercase-hyphenated. |
| `catalog_version` | string | yes | Semantic version of this entry (e.g. `0.1`). |
| `last_updated` | string | yes | `MM-DD-YY HH:MM` per project standard. |
| `tier` | integer | yes | 1 (universal core), 2 (sales pipeline), 3 (vertical), 4 (nonprofit), 5 (comms detail). |
| `entry_kind` | enum | yes | `universal` or `subclass`. |
| `parent_entity` | string | conditional | Required when `entry_kind: subclass`. Catalog ID of the parent entity. |
| `discriminator` | object | conditional | Required when `entry_kind: subclass`. Names the parent attribute and value that selects this subclass. |

| `data_model_role` | enum | yes | `anchor`, `event`, `classifier`, `junction`, `log`, `document`. Lets V2 reason about entities at the type level. |
| `typically_required` | boolean | yes | Is this entity required for any meaningful CRM deployment, or optional? |
| `common_synonyms` | array | no | Other names the same concept goes by (e.g. `[Company, Organization, Constituent Organization]`). |
| `systems` | array | yes | Per-system equivalence info (one entry per surveyed system). |
| `attributes` | array | yes | The attribute list — see `Attribute schema` below. |
| `relationships` | array | no | Inter-entity relationships — see `Relationship schema` below. |
| `sources` | array | yes | Citations: title and URL for each authoritative source consulted. |

### `systems[]` schema (per-system equivalence)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

| `notes` | string | no | Cross-system divergence, naming differences, or other implementation considerations. |

### `relationships[]` schema (per-relationship)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target` | string | yes | Catalog ID of the related entity. |
| `cardinality` | enum | yes | One of `one-to-one`, `one-to-many`, `many-to-one`, `many-to-many`. |
| `role` | enum | yes | One of `parent`, `child`, `peer`, `polymorphic`. |

## Sourcing methodology

For every entry in this catalog, claims are grounded in the following sources, in order of authority:

1. **Official documentation** — each system's authoritative reference (object reference, field reference, admin guide).
2. **Official API / developer guides** — each system's REST or developer documentation, which typically gives more rigorous schema information than admin docs (types, requiredness, enum values, max lengths).
3. **Direct schema inspection** — for the three open-source systems with public source code (EspoCRM, CiviCRM, Salesforce NPSP), the actual schema files in the system's repository are consulted as ground truth where they add fidelity beyond what docs alone provide.

Community/admin guides (third-party blog posts, consultant write-ups, implementation partner content) are explicitly excluded as a primary source — too much variability and staleness risk. The `usage` and `business_context` prose draws on general industry knowledge of how these entities are used in practice and is not directly cited.

Each entity's `sources[]` block lists every authoritative URL consulted for that entry. A claim that cannot be supported by one of these sources is not in the catalog.

## How V2 uses the catalog

Once V2's methodology entity schema is built (Step 0 follow-on), the catalog ingests into the database as seed data. From there V2 surfaces it to users in the following ways:

**Reference library.** While a user is drafting an entity definition during Inventory Reconciliation or Entity PRD work, V2 displays the catalog entry for the closest-matching base entity alongside the draft, so the user sees how Salesforce / HubSpot / Attio / EspoCRM / CiviCRM / NPSP / Bloomerang typically represent the same concept.

**Starter templates.** When a user picks a base entity from the catalog, V2 pre-populates a draft entity with the most commonly-used standard attributes. The user edits down or adds to. Reduces blank-page friction.

**Advisor / gap-checker.** When a user defines their own entity, V2 compares the draft against the catalog and flags missing attributes that are standard in 5+ surveyed systems with a prompt like "Most CRMs that have a Contact entity also include `last_modified`, `owner`, and `do_not_contact` — do you want those?"

**Cross-system mapper.** When a deployment target is selected (Attio, EspoCRM, HubSpot, etc.), V2 uses the catalog's `systems[]` blocks to translate the user's domain entity into the target backend's native entity / attribute names. The same `mechanism` vocabulary on subclasss lets V2 know how to deploy a subclass (record type, subtype, separate object, etc.) to the chosen backend.

The interview methodology consumes the same catalog through the `business_context` and `usage` prose, which are written specifically to give interviewers context-aware probing questions for each entity and attribute.
