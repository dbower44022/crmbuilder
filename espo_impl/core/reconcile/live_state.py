"""Capture live EspoCRM config in the shapes the diff engine consumes.

The field path produces ``{yaml_entity: {yaml_field: current_dict}}`` — the
``live`` input to :func:`...diff_engine.diff_fields` — reusing the same
enumeration and name-reversal helpers the Audit feature uses
(``get_entity_field_list``, ``classify_field``, ``strip_field_c_prefix``) so
reconciliation sees fields by their YAML names and the comparison stays identical
to the forward CHECK. The i18n label lookup is injected as ``label_resolver``
(entityDefs carries no ``label`` — labels live in the translation system),
verified against the live CBM instance.

The relationship, layout, and role/team paths (``capture_relationships`` /
``capture_layouts`` / ``capture_roles_teams``) feed
:func:`...diff_engine.diff_relationships` / :func:`...diff_engine.diff_layouts` /
:func:`...security_diff.diff_roles` + :func:`...security_diff.diff_teams`. Rather
than re-implement discovery, these **reuse the Audit machinery's tested
discovery + reverse-mappers** (``AuditManager._discover_relationships`` /
``_discover_roles`` / ``_discover_teams``) driven by a throwaway ``AuditReport``,
and the raw ``client.get_layout`` for the layout live side (``diff_layouts``
compares raw EspoCRM payloads directly). All capture methods stay read-only.
